## Overview
This repository contains the data extraction pipeline, optimization algorithms, and interactive web application for the paper: **"A Non-Extensive Statistical Framework for Exoplanet Demographics: Applying Tsallis Entropy to Kepler Stellar Observables."**

Standard exoplanetary demographic models rely on Boltzmann-Gibbs statistical mechanics. However, planet formation within a protoplanetary disk is driven by long-range gravitational interactions, resulting in heavily correlated, non-ergodic dynamics. This project applies **Tsallis Non-Extensive Statistical Mechanics** to $N \approx 197,000$ stars from the Kepler DR25 catalog to prove that the exoplanet probability distribution possesses extreme heavy tails ($q \approx 1.8591$).

## Repository Structure

* `data_fetch.ipynb`: Connects to the NASA Exoplanet Archive API (TAP) to download and clean the complete Kepler DR25 stellar catalog, preventing selection bias.
* `tsallis_optimizer.ipynb`: The core mathematical engine. Uses L-BFGS-B Maximum Likelihood Estimation to fit the Tsallis $q$-exponential distribution to the observational data. Includes Likelihood Profile scanning and Bootstrap uncertainty verification.
* `app.py`: A Gradio-based web application allowing users to interactively calculate the exoplanet hosting probability for arbitrary stellar parameters.
* `*.png`: Publication-ready visualizations generated by the optimization suite.

## Installation

To run this code locally, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AhmedHeshamEG/Tsallis-Exoplanet-Demographics.git
cd Tsallis-Exoplanet-Demographics
pip install -r requirements.txt

```
## Usage

1. **Fetch the Data:** Run `data_fetch.ipynb` to download the live Kepler data from NASA. This will generate `kepler_clean_demographics.csv` locally.
2. **Run the Physics Optimizer:** Execute `tsallis_optimizer.ipynb` to calculate the Negative Log-Likelihood, perform the Likelihood Profile scan, and generate the probability curves.
3. **Launch the App:** Run the interactive probability calculator locally by executing:
```bash
python app.py

```



## Web Application

You do not need to install anything to test the mathematical model. A live interactive version of `app.py` is hosted on Hugging Face Spaces:
